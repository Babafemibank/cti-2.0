## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to use grid box layout to create a responsive design.


### Continued development

I need to develop myself more with the grid box layout, how to place an item in a more desired place and be able to change the orders of child items in a container


### Useful resources
